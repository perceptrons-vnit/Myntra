## Overview
Fast fashion has caused a massive increase in the rate at which new trends are set.

A lot of companies make replica of luxury products at an affordable price. 

As a result it is getting difficult for the average consumer to select apparels from such a vast variety. 

The problem is further elevated by the lack of interaction with the product which exists in traditional shopping, since it is difficult to choose a apparel without trial.
## Objective
With the rise of fast fashion, it is difficult to keep track of ever changing trends. 

A model that would help the user filter the products based on the latest trends will make the shopping experience a lot smoother and give Myntra an edge over other e-commerce sites.

Our model detects the latest trends in the market to help the user make the right choice. It would serve as each individualâ€™s own personal, low budget stylist. 

The Virtual Trial Room will provide an easy and pleasant experience for any user.
